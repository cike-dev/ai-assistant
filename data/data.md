## 📂 `data/` – The Agent's Conversation Logic

This folder contains files that define your AI assistant’s core skills using **flows**—structured conversation patterns guiding how the agent interacts with users to achieve specific goals.

**What you'll find:**
- **career/**: Career-related advice and guidance flows (e.g., career tips, job search help)
- **general/**: General conversational flows (greetings, feedback, handoff to human agents, farewells, common patterns)
- **others/**: Miscellaneous fallback or catch-all flows for unrecognized input
- **support/**: Support-related flows (e.g., school support and other assistance topics)

**Edit the YAML files in these folders** to add new skills, update conversation steps, or customize how your AI assistant handles different user requests.
