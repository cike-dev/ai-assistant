First and foremost, ensure that uv is installed
Use uv to create a virtual environment (with python 3.12)
Activate the virtual environment (See Rasa docs)
Follow the steps below

----

Use this command to install the packages in requirements.txt:
    uv pip install -r requirements.txt

--- 

To install any other package, use: uv pip install <package-name>

---

If you come across an error or a message like this from uv:
    warning: Failed to hardlink files; falling back to full copy. This may lead to degraded performance.
        If the cache and target directories are on different filesystems, hardlinking may not be supported.
        If this is intentional, set `export UV_LINK_MODE=copy` or use `--link-mode=copy` to suppress this warning.

Run this command: export UV_LINK_MODE=copy
