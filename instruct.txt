Run this command: export UV_LINK_MODE=copy
to avoid a message like this from uv:
    warning: Failed to hardlink files; falling back to full copy. This may lead to degraded performance.
        If the cache and target directories are on different filesystems, hardlinking may not be supported.
        If this is intentional, set `export UV_LINK_MODE=copy` or use `--link-mode=copy` to suppress this warning.
