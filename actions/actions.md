## 📂 `actions/` – The AI Assistant's Toolkit

This folder contains the Python files that define **custom actions** your AI assistant can perform. These actions handle complex logic, external system integration, and information retrieval specific to **educational and career guidance**.

**What you'll find:**
* **career/**: Actions related to career advice, job search strategies, skill gap analysis, and professional development.
* **school\_support/**: Actions providing educational support, such as fetching general school info or providing contact information for school advisors.
* **general/**: Core, general-purpose actions like session management, system logging, or facilitating a handoff to a human operator.
* **others/**: Generic custom actions template

**Edit Python files in this folder** to add new guidance features, integrate with student helper database, or extend the assistant's counseling capabilities.
