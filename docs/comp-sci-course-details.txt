Distinctive Features of the Course:
The BSc (Hons) Computer Science will allow you to gain the understanding, knowledge, practical skills, attitudes, and values required to be a computer scientist after graduation. Knowledge is steadily introduced in the core principles of computer science, such as programming and problem solving, internet software architecture, databases, object-oriented programming, computational maths, and academic skills. The course then builds upon these core topics by focusing on full stack (i.e., web) development, collaborative development and providing a range of options will allow you to tailor your degree to match your career ambitions and interests. You can tailor your course to explore areas such as cloud systems, data mining, artificial intelligence, games and interactive applications, networking, mobile development, big data, and further full stack development. You will be able to demonstrate and apply knowledge and understanding of the essential facts, concepts, principles, theories, and practices in the area, enabling graduate employment in computer science related roles, such as software developer, programmer, web developer, Artificial intelligence engineer and interactive 3D app / game developer. You will also develop a range of transferable skills in problem solving, communication, project management, self-management, and direction as well as the ability to gather, synthesise, evaluate and reflect on information from relevant sources. You will also be able to demonstrate a range of social, legal, ethical, and professional skills required for continuing professional development in security, worldwide. You will be taught by a professional team of lecturers who have significant research and industrial experience. Many of our staff are Fellows and Members of the Industry’s professional body the British Computer Society. You will be offered the opportunity to undertake a placement year, where you gain invaluable experience in the workplace, before returning to complete your final year. Many students have found this to be a real asset when it comes to finding a job after graduation.

Educational Aims of the Course:
This course aims to produce software developers who can seamlessly make the transition from university to the international computer industry. This is achieved by providing a thorough grounding in the core principles of computer science and integrating these with computer languages, tools, techniques, and methodologies used by computer professionals worldwide. Our Computer Science course offers you the flexibility to pursue areas of particular interest to you such as web, cloud systems, data mining, artificial intelligence, games and interactive applications, networking, mobile development, and big data. Additionally, we will prepare you with the key skills needed to keep abreast of future developments.

# Teaching, Learning and Assessment
You will engage with a range of learning activities which will include lectures, tutorials, workshops and on-line forums and in class discussions. The learning activities on your course will develop distinctive graduate attributes that will make you stand out and enhance your employability. These skills will be
embedded into the curriculum throughout your course. Examples include:
- Digitally Literacy: All Computer Science graduates will be users of advanced technologies. However, on your course you will develop your skills to encompass literacy more fully such as learning how to find information and how to take best advantage of digital resources and the Internet to make you effective in the Information Age.

- Global Citizenship: On each level of your course you will learn about social, legal and ethical aspects of Computing, which will broaden your understanding of the way the world works and how communication and collaboration are evolving.

- Knowledgeable and Enterprising: Throughout your course you will build up your professional and employability skills and learn to apply the knowledge you have acquired in an enterprising way. You will constantly nurture your own intellectual curiosity. The tools, methodologies and techniques that you will learn have been carefully selected to prepare you with the skills that employers demand and the opportunities for work based learning and placements will allow you to gain the vital experience that they often expect.

Assessment Methods:
At the University of Wolverhampton, a variety of modes of assessment will be used to support and test your learning and progress and to help you develop capabilities that are valued beyond your University studies and into your working life. Your course may include a variety of assessment activities:
- Written examinations (including online examinations, open and closed book examinations and quizzes)
- Coursework (for example, essays, reports, portfolios, project proposals and briefs, CVs, poster presentation)
- Practical (for example, oral and video presentations, laboratory work, performances, practical skills assessment)

In the final year of your undergraduate degree, and at the end of your postgraduate degree, you are likely to be expected to write an extended piece of work or research, such as a dissertation or a practice-based piece of research.

# Student Support
Course support: At the start of each year of your course you will be assigned a Personal Tutor who will guide you through the induction process and provide support and academic counselling throughout the year on an appointment basis. They should be able to offer you advice and guidance to help you liaise with other staff and support facilities in the Faculty and University. You should meet your Personal Tutor at least 3 times a year, which must include meetings that you are invited to at critical points in your course.

The Personal Tutor provides academic counselling and will be accessible throughout the week on a drop-in or appointment basis to discuss timetables, requests for extensions, requests for extenuating circumstances, general concerns about study and student life and general programme planning. The Personal Tutor will act as a first point of contact in relation to leave of absence (including returning after leave), withdrawal, transferring to another course (internal and external) and changes to mode of attendance. Your Programme Leader will be available thereafter for meetings by appointment to discuss leave of absence, withdrawal, transferring to another course (internal and external), changes to mode of attendance, returning after leave of absence and direct entrants.

Subject support: Tutorials, workshops, seminars, and meetings - provide the primary opportunities for students to interact with staff on topics relating to modules. All modules provide at least one of these forms of faceto-face support.

Formative feedback: tutors provide personalised written feedback on most summative assessments. The mechanism for feedback from purely formative tasks varies between assessments but will always be provided in some form. On-line formative tasks often provide feedback straight away. On occasions tutors may provide generalised verbal feedback to the whole class on points relating to an assessment. Assessment and subject-based surgeries provide additional student support for subjects that students often need extra help with. They are often concentrated around the times when assessments take place. Revision sessions are provided for many modules that have tests and enable you to interact with tutors to review parts of the course. Mock exams and tests may provide opportunities to experience an examination environment before the final summative test and give you feedback on your understanding.

# Employability in the Curriculum
Throughout your course you will build up your professional and employability skills and learn to apply the knowledge you have acquired in an enterprising way. You will constantly nurture your own intellectual curiosity. The tools, methodologies, and techniques that you will learn have been carefully selected to prepare you with the skills that employers demand and the opportunities for work-based learning and  placements will allow you to gain the vital experience that they often expect.
