Your Course
About 'Your Course'
Higher education requires students to take more responsibility for their own learning, developing skills as lifelong learners. This includes organizing time for engagement activities such as attending timetabled sessions, watching online lectures, completing pre-session work on Canvas (the University’s Virtual Learning Environment), additional reading, accessing study skills workshops, using university facilities like labs and studios, and completing assessments. Failure to engage within 50 days of the course start date, after repeated contact attempts by the University, may result in withdrawal. See the Student Engagement Policy for details.

Upon enrolment, students can access the Course Guide through eVision, containing essential information for their studies. The University’s Academic Regulations outline requirements for undergraduate, postgraduate taught, and research degree programmes, forming a framework for delivering programmes and making awards. By accepting a course offer, students enter a formal contract with the University and agree to abide by its Regulations, Codes of Conduct, and Bye Laws. Students should read and understand policies related to academic and non-academic conduct, use of facilities, complaints, and equal opportunities, including the University’s complaints procedure.

Courses relate to credit levels 4-8 (higher education qualifications), aligned with the national Framework for Higher Education Qualifications (FHEQ). Course learning outcomes reflect achievements at each level, ensuring equivalence with other universities via Subject Benchmark Statements, which detail academic standards and expectations for graduates in specific subjects. Academic staff provide assignment briefs to clarify expectations, which evolve throughout the degree.
- Level 4: Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of underlying concepts, with ability to evaluate, interpret, and communicate them.
- Level 5: Apply concepts outside initial context, evaluate problem-solving approaches, and understand knowledge limits.
- Level 6 (BA/BSc): Show systematic understanding of key aspects, apply methods for projects, and critically evaluate arguments and data.
- Level 7 (Master’s): Demonstrate systematic knowledge at the subject’s cutting edge, critical awareness of current research, and practical understanding of research techniques.

Courses consist of modules, each with academic credits (1 credit = 10 hours of study). Full-time students typically take three modules (60 credits) per semester, expecting around 55 hours weekly, including contact time, preparation, independent learning, and assessments. Credits accumulate towards the qualification, e.g., 360 credits for a degree (120 credits each at levels 4, 5, and 6). Modules are categorized as core (compulsory), optional, pre-requisite, co-requisite, or prohibited, with learning outcomes assessed through various activities.

How Will I Learn?
Higher education uses a blended learning approach, combining recorded lectures, online resources, and face-to-face teaching. Students are expected to engage in independent learning to enhance knowledge, with timetabled sessions introducing ideas for further study. Additional resources are highlighted within modules to support learning, requiring students to develop organizational skills.

Learning Activities
Modules use various approaches, including:
- Lectures: Introduce topics, often large groups, with less active participation.
- Seminars: Smaller, interactive discussions for deeper topic exploration.
- Tutorials: Small groups or one-to-one, discussing understanding or work.
- Practical sessions: Apply knowledge in environments like labs, studios, or fieldwork.
- Group work: Develop communication, teamwork, and organization skills for assessments.
- Work placements: Gain experience, varying from weeks to a year.

Success requires independent study, developing thoughts and ideas, conducting research, reflecting on learning, planning skill development, and acting on tutor feedback. Critical evaluation involves questioning information sources, evidence, and key points, encouraging curiosity and active participation.

Tips from Students and Tutors
- Student Tips: Arrive on time for lessons, ask questions appropriately, know suitable learning spaces (e.g., libraries for work, sociable areas for discussion), act respectfully and maturely, and avoid inappropriate behavior to protect investment in education.
- Tutor Tips: Ask questions, use Canvas for module materials (videos, readings, assessments), utilize library resources (e.g., www.wlv.ac.uk/skills), allow time for learning beyond lectures, and seek help from tutors if facing difficulties.
