University Software List

An A-Z listing of all University licensed software for on-campus and home use is available but access requires University email and password. The list provides information on how to obtain the software and compatible devices.

1. AppsAnywhere
Over 200 applications are available on University PCs across all campuses, accessible via the desktop icon or start menu. More than 70 applications are available for students on personal laptops/PC, mostly for Windows devices. For Apple/Mac, consult your teacher or course leader.

To access AppsAnywhere:
Visit https://appsanywhere.wlv.ac.uk and log in with University credentials. First-time users must download and install the Cloudpaging player by selecting the blue box prompt. Some apps may experience reduced performance for the first 3-5 minutes as they download in the background.

2. Microsoft 365

Microsoft 365 is accessed by logging into https://office.com with University email and password. Students can install Office 365 on up to 5 personal devices via the "Install Office" tab on the website, following on-screen steps. Mobile access is available through app store installations.

3. University Software Download Catalogue
Software like SPSS or NVivo can be installed on personal laptops via http://www3.wlv.ac.uk/its/downloads/, requiring login and following instructions, including activation codes for some software (e.g., SPSS has a three-step process).
