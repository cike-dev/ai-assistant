Academic Regulations Overview

Changes to Academic Regulations 2019 - FAQs: The new regulations on level progression and compensation will apply from August 2019, affecting student progression into the next academic year.

For January starters, the regulations will apply at the next progression point in January 2020. Resit marks at Levels 3 and 4 from January 2019 to January 2020 will not be capped if a minimum mark of 20% is achieved in the first attempt. January starters will have a third sit for second semester modules, not first semester modules.

Changes to extenuating circumstances and extensions will apply from September 2019 onwards, with further information provided at the start of the 2019/20 academic year.

Year-long modules allow a maximum of two sits per year, with no third sit available as there is no ratified mark after the first semester. To take more than 120 credits in a year, contact the Faculty Student Services Office. For 2019/20, students failing one module (20 credits) will automatically be registered for 140 credits; those failing two modules (40 credits) will be registered for a mixed diet capped at 120 credits.
For further advice, contact the Faculty Student Services Office.

University Policies and Regulations
Admission is subject to academic requirements and possibly specific conditions like Entry Agreements. Upon registration, students must consent to University Policies and Regulations, including payment terms. Some departments may have additional requirements, especially for professionally accredited programs.

It is important to understand policies related to academic and non-academic conduct, facility use, complaints, and equal opportunities. The University may terminate or suspend complaint or appeal consideration if student behavior is deemed unacceptable, such as aggressive demands or repeated representations on resolved matters.

Student Protection Plan
The University, registered with the Office for Students, publishes a Student Protection Plan detailing actions in case a course, campus, or institution closes, ensuring students can complete their studies.
