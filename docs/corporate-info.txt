Student Engagement Policy Summary for Student Support and Counseling
1. Policy Overview
The University is committed to supporting students to engage fully with their studies to maximize academic success. This policy applies to all students on taught programmes, defining engagement as active attendance, regular use of resources, participation in scheduled events, accessing core systems, completing assessments, and interacting with staff and peers. Engagement is compulsory and monitored, with potential withdrawal for persistent non-engagement. Separate policies apply to apprentices and postgraduate research students.

2. Support for Engagement
The University supports engagement through:
- Pre-entry and induction information to familiarize students with programme requirements and support services.
- High-quality teaching, learning experiences, and early feedback opportunities.
- Access to programme-related learning resources and support materials.
- A range of academic and support services, including financial support, disability support, mental health and wellbeing, and career development.
- Co- and extra-curricular activities to enhance the student experience and employability.

Personal tutors and academic coaches advise, monitor, and encourage engagement throughout the student journey. Students can view their attendance and engagement data via the student check-in system.

3. Responsibilities and Monitoring
Students must:
- Engage with monitoring procedures, including attendance recording via digital registers.
- Attend all timetabled sessions, including placements and fieldwork, unless studying by distance learning.
- Regularly access and interact with the Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) Canvas and other digital systems like e:Vision and My WLV.
- Complete assessments on time, with options to apply for extensions or claim extenuating circumstances if needed.

The University monitors engagement, including attendance and VLE interaction, to identify issues early and support students. Non-engagement, such as absence for 60 consecutive days or below 60% attendance, triggers notifications and action plans, with potential withdrawal for non-compliance, especially for international students affecting UKVI sponsorship.

4. Support in Difficulties
If experiencing difficulties, students should:
- Report absences via the student check-in system, especially for illnesses exceeding two teaching weeks, and contact academic coaches/personal tutors or faculty administration for advice, including leave of absence options.
- Seek support from Faculty Student Services, Directorate of Student and Academic Services, or the Students Union for impartial advice.
- Discuss options with personal tutors or academic coaches early to avoid withdrawal, exploring alternatives like mode of study changes before decisions are finalized.

Appeals
Students can appeal withdrawal decisions by demonstrating significant irregularities in policy application, with details available in the academic appeal process.

50-Day Engagement Regulation
Within the first 50 days, students must enroll, register for modules, attend at least 25% of teaching sessions (higher for PSRB-accredited programmes), access and progress in Canvas courses, meet with personal tutors/academic coaches, and complete relevant tasks like Disclosure and Barring Service checks. Faculties contact students at weeks 4, 5, and 7 to ensure engagement, with potential termination by Day 50 for non-engagement.
