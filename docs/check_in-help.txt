Student Check-In System
Student Check-In is an online system for all students at the University of Wolverhampton to register attendance at timetabled learning activities. It is web-based and accessible via phone, tablet, laptop, or PC through the MyWLV app or at myattendance.wlv.ac.uk. Students must use it for all scheduled teaching activities, both online and on campus. Attendance is crucial for studies, but the University supports students who cannot attend due to illness or unforeseen circumstances. Absences can be reported through the system. It is important to record attendance only for sessions attended, as fraudulent recording may lead to disciplinary actions under the Student Code of Conduct. For difficulties preventing attendance, contact ASK@WLV for support.

Essentially,
The system records attendance for undergraduate and postgraduate taught students. It helps personal tutors and academic coaches identify students needing support for early intervention. Attendance registration is compulsory as per University policy. Students can view their attendance records since starting the course using the system. For mistakes in records, contact ASK@WLV.
